  title : "The History of The United Church"
  content : "Both Presbyterians and American Baptists have a long history in the Canandaigua area.  The Presbyterian Church was organized in 1870, and the present sanctuary building was dedicated in 1872.  The American Baptist Church has an even longer history, with three different church buildings having been erected--the first in 1835.


On December 13, 1942, the First Baptist Church of Canandaigua was totally destroyed by fire.  The Baptists held services in various buildings around town for five years.  The Presbyterian Church offered to have them worship jointly.  The offer was accepted May 11, 1947.  In 1961, the name was formally changed to The United Church (Presbyterian-American Baptist) of Canandaigua, New York.


Since 1966, The United Church has only had three pastors. Rev. Fred Magley served from 1966-1989.  Rev. Dr. Jim Kerr was called as Pastor in 1991, retiring in 2018. In 2021, Rev. Dr. Wade Allen began serving as Pastor."
