Worship is central to the life and practice of The United Church. During the summer (Memorial Day weekend hrough Labor Day weekend), we have one worship service, which begins at 9:30 AM.  


Beginning the weekend after Labor Day, we will gather in two worship services each week (8:45 AM and 11:00 AM). These two services will continue through the weekend before Memorial Day."
